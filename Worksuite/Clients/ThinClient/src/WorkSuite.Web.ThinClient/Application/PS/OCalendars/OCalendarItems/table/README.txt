This resource (Operations Calendars Table) has been strongly coupled to a presenter (View Operations Calendar Page Presenter), 
which happens to be the only presenter presenting this resource. If we ever needed to render the resource (Operations Calendars Table)
in another page, we would be stuffed.

It needs to be decoupled in order to be re-useable by other pages.
